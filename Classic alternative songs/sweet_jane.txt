"Sweet Jane" is a song by American rock band The Velvet Underground.
It appeared on their 1970 album "Loaded", albeit without the bridge section.
The missing section was eventually restored for the Peel Slowly and See box set in 1995.
It was eventually released as a single in 1973 after vocalist Lou Reed had left the band.
The song was written by Reed, who continued to perform it at his solo live performances.
A cover by Cowboy Junkies was featured in Oliver Stone's 1994 film "Natural Born Killers".
