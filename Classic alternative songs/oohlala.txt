"Ooh La La" is a 1973 song from English rock band Faces.
It was written by Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood.
It was the title track for the band's last studio album of the same name.
Wood sang the song, which was unexpected since Faces songs are usually sang by Rod Stewart and Lane.
The song describes a conversation between an old man and his grandson.
"Ooh La La" was prominently featured in the 1998 Wes Anderson movie "Rushmore".
