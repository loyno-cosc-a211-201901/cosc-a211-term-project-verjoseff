"There She Goes" is a song by English rock band The La's.
It was written by the band's frontman Lee Mavers.
It was featured on the band's eponymous debut album.
First released as a single in 1988, a 1990 remixed version produced by Steve Lillywhite charted at number 13 in the UK.
The song is reputed to be about heroin. Or it could be just about unrequited love.
Either way, it's a deceptively catchy tune that became the precursor to the Britpop movement of the 90s.
