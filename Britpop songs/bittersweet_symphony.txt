"Bitter Sweet Symphony" is a song by English alternative rock band The Verve.
It was written by the band's frontman Richard Ashcroft.
The song was known for its strings, which sampled Andrew Loog Oldham's orchestral cover of the Rolling Stones' cover "The Last Time".
Because of this, the band faced a plagiarism charge, and the band did not receive any royalties from the song for 20 years.
In 2019, Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards handed the publishing rights of the song back to The Verve.
The song was released in the UK in 1997 as the first single from their third studio album "Urban Hymns" (1997).
